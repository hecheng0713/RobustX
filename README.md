# RobustX
RobustX is an operating system kernel for running multiple concurrent on Cortex-A, Cortex-M and RISC-V based platforms. RobustX is written in Rust, a system programming language that provides compile-time memory safety. RobustX uses Rust to protect the kernel from platform specific device drivers as well as isolate device drivers from each other.
